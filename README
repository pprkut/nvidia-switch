nvidia-switch can be used to switch between the stock xorg driver and
the nvidia driver, but it will not edit xorg.conf for you; you have to do
that manually.

Currently this requires the upstream nvidia binary driver to be installed
in a special way, as it is done by the SlackBuilds on SlackBuilds.org

Usage of nvidia-switch:
  nvidia-switch --xorg	 <-->  switch to the stock xorg files

  nvidia-switch --nvidia  <--> switch to the proprietary nvidia files

  nvidia-switch --cleanup <--> switch to the stock xorg file and remove all
    symlinks created by nvidia-switch

  nvidia-switch --check-nvidia <--> Check if everything is setup correctly
    for nvidia's driver

  nvidia-switch --check-xorg <--> Check if everything is setup correctly
    for xorg's driver"

  nvidia-switch --check-cleanup <--> Check if everything has been cleaned
    up correctly"
